      <p id=p_just> This visulation utilizes a geojson file created from the Manhattan Pluto dataset. After loading the json data,
       I established the x and y values, as well as the lot geometry, for the scatterplot by iterating through the json. In order to
       create the lot geometry, I then iterated through the coordinates of the verticies of each shape. I added or subtracted a unique
       x constrant and unique y constant from every coordinate within a given lot shape in order to transform the location of that lot from
       its position within the map to its position within the scatterplot.
      </p>

      <p id=p_just> These processes were relatively complex (at least to me!); if I had more time there are numerous things I would
        include/improve for this graphic. Due to the many transformations the datums (x,y axes) at some point became off relative to where i expected them
        to be. This did not allow me to easily plot the scale axes for built and potential building area. Because all of the vacant lots fall on
        the x-axis they are lost somewhere in cyber world as well. I would really like to fix this.
      </p>

      <p id=p_just> Ideally, when the mouse hovers over a given polygon, I would like it to highlight (with black stroke) and I would like
      the address to pop up (which I could retrieve from the json).
