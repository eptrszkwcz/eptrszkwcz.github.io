        <p id=p_just> This visualization seeks to present many features of the Pluto dataset within a static image through the manipulation
          of position, geometry, and color. Like a tradition scatter plot, the visualization shows the relationship between
          two variables--existing building floor area and maximum allowable floor area. The shape of each data point takes the form
           of the Pluto lot that it represents and preserves relative geometry, size, and cardinal orientation. This allows the viewer
           to easily understand the variation in lot size as well as any existing correlations between lot geometry and other features.
            Lastly, the lots were shaded using conventional Pluto land use colors in order to clearly disaggregate the dataset and
            show trends by land use category.</p>

        <p  id=p_just>Given that the primary intention of the visualization is to indicate the degree lots
            are over or under built, there is a singular demarcation between the two categories to distinguish between the two
            classifications. The visualization reveals a variety of interesting trends (significant amounts of underbuilt residential,
            overbuilt comercial) especially when disaggregated by land use type. </p>

        <p  id=p_just>Grasshopper was used to filter and spatially manipulate the manhattan Pluto shapefile. </p>

          commercial lots - this most likely reflects large office buildings that were given public plaza FAR credits. </p>
